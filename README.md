## 📘 About the Book

This is not a textbook.  
No math dumps. No 500-page theory spiral.  
Just logic, structure, and clear thinking — the way it should’ve been explained from the start.

> I didn’t write this book to help others.  
> I wrote it because I *had to understand it myself*.  
> And now that I do — it’s here. Free.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

A step-by-step guide that starts with *"what is logic?"*  
and ends with *"how to build your own neural network."*

- **Stage 1: Foundations** — thinking, logic, the single neuron  
- **Stage 2: Architecture** — how layers form networks  
- **Stage 3: Control** — building your own network + full mindset

Every chapter is sharp, minimal, and logical — no fluff, no filler.
